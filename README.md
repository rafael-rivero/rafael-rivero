# Welcome!

I'm Ralph, and welcome to my (what I hope eventually reflects a satisfying, epic progression arc of a solid software developer) repository. While I have a long way to go, I learn from my mistakes quickly, and will be pushing more code, now with a wiser, even-handed approach to using LLMs as a learning tool. So, expect frequent changes to this README, as my personal projects focus changes with the wind. I will continue with the fun, low-level programming and emulation projects, but they don't put food on the table, so I'll see what that newfangled AI stuff is all about...

### 🔧 Projects I’m Exploring

- 🎮 **Godot Platformer** – A Mario Bros–style prototype with patrolling enemies, screen wrap, and custom mechanics using `CharacterBody3D`
- 🖌️ **Paint App** – Basic drawing app made in Pygame, and in other languages in the future (NES/SMS palettes)
- 📐 **Math Playground** – Visual experiments in vector math, planes, and calculus
- 💾 **Atari/NES Programming** – Studying 6502 architecture with a long-term goal of building for real hardware

### 🔍 What I’m Into

- Fast prototyping → focused deep work, rinse and repeat
- Learning by building (and disassembling)  
- Systems thinking, creative tools, visual storytelling  
- Staying humble, teachable, and anti-hype  

---

### 🛠️ Tech I Use (or Tinker With)

`C` · `C++` · `SDL` · `Godot` · `GDScript` · `C#` · `Git` · `Python` · `Lua` · `Elixir`
Creative Tools: `Blender` · `Photoshop` · `Illustrator` · `Procreate (iOS)`
Web: `HTML/CSS`

### 📘 Casually Learning

🕹️ **Low-Level & Retro Systems**  
- `6502 ASM` – Atari VCS, NES  
- `Z80 ASM` – Sega Master System, Game Gear  
- `65816 ASM` – SNES  
- `68000 ASM` – Genesis, Sega CD, 32X  
- `HuC6280 ASM` – PC Engine, PC-FX  
- `V810 ASM` – Virtual Boy  
- `SH-4 ASM` – Dreamcast

📐 **Math & Visualizations**  
- `Linear Algebra` – transformations, rendering, geometry  
- `Calculus` – curves, motion, systems modeling

There's a game in there somewhere in my future, but for now, I'll level up on these skills and won't shy away from using frameworks to get things going. Knowing myself, I will always optimize for performance even if it breaks the game for a while.

### 📬 Let’s Connect

- Open to opportunities where the mundane results in breakthroughs may not be immediately marketable, but produce real, teachable moments that build valuable niche knowledge
- Prefer work where I can explore, refine, and contribute long-term, but having that production-ready pressure needs to be there, or else my heart isn't into it
- I learn by doing, but retention really picks up when teaching others
