# Welcome!

I'm Ralph, and welcome to my (what I hope eventually reflects a satisfying, epic redemption arc of a failed software engineer) repository. I learn from my mistakes quickly, and will be pushing more code, now with a wiser, even-handed approach to using LLMs as a learning tool. So, expect frequent changes to this README, as my personal projects focus changes with the wind. I will continue with the fun, low-level programming and emulation projects, but they don't put food on the table, so I'll see what that newfangled AI stuff is all about...

### 🔍 What Gets Me Out of Bed Each Morning

- Deep work that connects to a dignified human need, or scrap it.
- Learning by breaking (software and ideas).
- Visual storytelling, better user experiences everywhere.
- Striving for actual humility, the truth about myself, which in practice means give to receive.
- Innovative game mechanics.
- There's a never-before-seen retro-homage indie game title in there somewhere in my future as a developer. Skill issue, yeah yeah, for now, but it won't be long.

- Startup opportunities where breakthroughs may not be immediately palpable, but produce real, competitive momentum.
- Prefer work where I can break the rules (in a sandbox, of course), refine, and repeat.
- Production-ready pressure needs to be there, or else my heart isn't into it.
- I learn by teaching.
